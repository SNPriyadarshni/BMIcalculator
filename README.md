I built a simple yet interactive BMI Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically calculates BMI based on user inputs and displays the corresponding weight category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese) with colorful, responsive UI feedback.

ðŸ§© Key Features:

User-friendly input form

Instant BMI calculation

Clear category indicators with emoji-based feedback

Fully responsive styling using custom CSs


ðŸ’¡ This project helped me practice conditional logic, and user experience design.
